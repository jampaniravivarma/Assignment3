                <p>self-confidence is an attitude about your skills and abilities. It means
                   you accept and trust yourself and have a sense of control in your life. 
                   You know your strengths and weakness well, and have a positive view of yourself. 
                   You set realistic expectations and goals, communicate assertively, and can handle criticism.
                   On the other hand, low self-confidence might make you feel full of self-doubt, be passive or 
                   submissive, or have difficulty trusting others. You may feel inferior, unloved, or be sensitive 
                   to criticism. Feeling confident in yourself might depend on the situation. For instance, 
                   you can feel very confident in some areas, such as academics, but lack confidence in others, 
                   like relationships.
